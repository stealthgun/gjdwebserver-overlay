Subject: [PATCH] seat: Allow to cancel touches

After cancelation we destroy the touch points associated with this
surface as the Wayland spec says:

No further events are sent to the clients from that particular gesture.
Touch cancellation applies to all touch points currently active on this
client's surface. The client is responsible for finalizing the touch
points, future touch points on this surface may re-use the touch point
ID.

Closes: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/issues/2999
